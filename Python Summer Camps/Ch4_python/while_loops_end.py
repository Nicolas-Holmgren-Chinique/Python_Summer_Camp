"""
Below is my while loop.

Was yours similar? 


What did you do differently?


What did you learn?


"""

age = 12

while age < 18:
    print("Sorry you are not old enough to vote")
    age += 1 
    if age >= 18:
        print("Yay you can vote! ")

# Now there is a way to make this better, instead of having age = 12 lets use user input so we can get an age from the user. 

"""
If you don't remeber how to use user input look back at chapter 2.

go back to your code and do that.
